    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds (900g) chicken wings</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Your favorite wing sauce (e.g., buffalo, BBQ, or teriyaki)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels. This helps them get extra crispy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the baking powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Toss the chicken wings in the mixture until they are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Place the wings on the wire rack in a single layer. Make sure they are not touching each other to allow for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Bake the wings for 40-45 minutes, flipping them halfway through, until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the wings from the oven and toss them in your favorite wing sauce or serve the sauce on the side for dipping.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
