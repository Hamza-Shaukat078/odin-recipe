    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Be careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, chili flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Stir well and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add the chopped basil and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese and a few extra basil leaves for garnish.</li>
